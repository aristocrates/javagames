 * Reallu I didn't do much here, just made this so I can use that cheap trick
 * that karel uses so I don't have to clutter up the classes that actually do
 * stuff with these constants. Also, it reduces redundancy in a manner that makes
 * sure my code does not repeat itself in a redundant manner.
