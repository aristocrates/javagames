Version 1.0.0
Known bugs / game-play inconveniances:
1: Difficulty seeing links between towers sometimes, in particular when zoomed
out on farthest setting
2: Issues with sound "clicking" due to need to split up sound file into multiple
files to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors

Commentary / things that would be improved given more time:
1: The relatively high amount of coupling could likely be reduced with a
restructured design that does not rely on mutual references to eachother between
classes
